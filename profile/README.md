Magus Corp - What We Do is Magic
=====================================

Welcome to Magus Corp, we are a public benefit company, for-profit (The order of the tokens matter). Our mission is to make artificial intelligence (AI) accessible and affordable for everyone. We believe that AI is not just a tool but a human right, and we strive to leverage its power to revolutionize various industries and improve people's lives.

Open Source and Hardware
---------------------------

We believe in collaboration and openness, which is why all of our Public Knowledge Projects (PKP) are open-source and open hardware. You can download the code and modify it to fit your needs. We encourage everyone to contribute to our community and help us improve our projects. Although we don't have money to create bounties,we are in the preseed phase and are still broke as f. Looking to investors to go full time and accelerate the process. But we will do it regardless. For now we are just a bunch of human souls and they imaginnary friends trying to make an impact.

Our Process
------------

At Magus Corp, we use various AI models and techniques to train our models for different industries, governments, entities, and persons. From simple chatbots to models that help find new materials! We also breathe new life into old hardware by repurposing it for our products and processes. F programed obsolence! Reuse, Repurpuse, Recycle.

Our Public Knowledge Projects:
----------------------------

### Legislinho - Your Legislative Assistant

Legislinho is a transformer-based chatbot agent trained to assist and facilitate work with Brazilian legislation documents. We believe that every government should be transparent and non-reliable on foreign companies. Having all its sensitive data stored, processed, and worked "in-house" as opposed to sending it to an overseas server. Remember the 2015 NSA scandal? And now, the legislative power wants to send all the data? To us, it seems like a shitty idea. And they made it "pro bono" why is that?

*Public release date of the repository:* As soon we have a very shitty MVP.

### AlcheMyst Lab - The All-in-One Tool for Magicians

AlcheMyst Lab or Alchemical Mystical Lab is a Python, browser-based tool inspired by comfyui. It's a node-based, pipeline creation and managing tool capable of manipulating image, video, text, and all at the same time!

We want to give people that cannot code, but have an idea, the capability to execute it, with minimal study. And for the fullfledged manipulators of magical language (python in this case) we want to a easy interface to create custom nodes from code, onthefly. As well the insights that came from a visual representation of code.

*Public release date of the repository:* When we have a very shitty but stable MVP.

### Huginn - The Modular Drone

Huginn is a modular drone based on ESP32 designed to be expandable, allowing users to customize it according to their needs. With Huginn, you can use AI models for various purposes such as image and object recognition, tracking, and mapping. Civil and industrial applications are almost endless! Can an ESP32 run a model? Kinda, we can use a very small liquid NN to stabilize the flight. But the "intelligence" of the drone lives in your personal computer, personal cloud infrastructure, or rented cloud. Always in mind the objective, dirt cheap technology.

*Public release date of the repository:* When we have a very shitty but functional and in-field tested MVP.

### Node - Cheap Personal Server Appliance

Our personal server node is a low-configuration, open-source appliance created from old data center parts. It's an affordable way to create your own personal cloud 
server without breaking the bank. Our Node product is a personal server that has been transformed from used data center parts into an easy-to-use appliance. With its 
low configuration requirements, Node is the perfect solution for small businesses and individuals looking to get started with AI 
quickly and easily.

*Public release date of the repository:* When we have a scalable MVP.
